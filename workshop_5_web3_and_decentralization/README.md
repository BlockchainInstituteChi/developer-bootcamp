# Workshop 5: Web3 

### What is this?

This final module of the Blockchain Institute Developer Bootcamp provides a preliminary view of the Web3 technology stack and how it can be used to increase transparency and accountability online. Beginning with a review of the core technologies at play, we'll demonstrate how decentralized storage, computing, and identity can be combined to create digital ecosystems that empower the user and reduce risks of monopolization.

# Stuff You Should Know

## Web3 Stack

The Web3 stack refers to the components which together enable a decentralized internet. Since Ethereum's introduction of Smart Contracts a number of supporting technologies have evolved to provide supplemental capabilities and expand the functionality of these tools. 

### Decentralized Computing

Since Ethereum's debut in 2015, a number of decentralized computation networks have emerged, each with their own limitations and benefits. In each case, a network of peers participate in an economic game, earning rewards as they perform computational tasks. By spreading the computation across many nodes, these systems reduce fault risk and ensure long term stability of their networks. 

### Decentralized Storage

While torrenting has been a fairly commonplace activity online since the early 2000's, it's only recently that this technology has formally transitioned to a protocol and network based solution. In the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) network, users can store digital files across many peer nodes, and retrieve them using a hash address. This enables a wide range of applications which require data storage to persist in order to work properly. 

### Decentralized Identity

One of the major limitations of the Web 2.0 era comes from the lack of online credentials. In most cases, when a user is required to verify identity, they do so by uploading a copy of a physical identity document of some kind. Decentralized Identity solutions cultivate a sterile environment by linking these verification events to a set of digital keys, which can in turn be used to create trusted relationships without further transmissions of the identifying document.
