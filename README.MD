# Blockchain Institute 

## Developer Bootcamp

### Workshop 1
Our introductory workshop provides an overview of the basic operation of a local Bitcoin node, and the configuration of addresses, transaction creation, and confirmation. This lab uses the RegTest Bitcoin mode, which provides instant confirmations for local transactions for testing purposes. No need to download the whole blockchain - get started with Bitcoin today!

### Workshop 2
Once you've got the basics of operating a node worked out, we'll help you connect it to a sample web store. This lesson also covers how to use Ethereum via the Infura API, and how to use a hierarchical deterministic wallet to generate new keypairs for each transaction. 

### Workshop 3
While crypto payments are substantially faster than traditional wire transfers, they're still a bit slow for many consumer applications. One alternative is the Bitcoin Lightning network. In this session we'll explore how the network can be used to send Bitcoin payments nearly instantly, and help you set up a web store to do process these payments.
