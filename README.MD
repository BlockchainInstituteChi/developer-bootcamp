# Blockchain Institute 

## Developer Bootcamp
The Blockchain Institute Developer Bootcamp provides students with a simple framework of a web store to help them explore how blockchain technology can be used to increase security and accountability in digital product development. 

### Workshop 1: Running a Bitcoin Node
Our introductory workshop provides an overview of the basic operation of a local Bitcoin node, and the configuration of addresses, transaction creation, and confirmation. This lab uses the RegTest Bitcoin mode, which provides instant confirmations for local transactions for testing purposes. No need to download the whole blockchain - get started with Bitcoin today!

### Workshop 2: Building a Crypto-Compatible Web Store
Once you've got the basics of operating a node worked out, we'll help you connect it to a sample web store. This lesson also covers how to use Ethereum via the Infura API, and how to use a hierarchical deterministic wallet to generate new keypairs for each transaction. 

### Workshop 3: Implementing Second Layer Payments
While crypto payments are substantially faster than traditional wire transfers, they're still a bit slow for many consumer applications. One alternative is the Bitcoin Lightning network. In this session we'll explore how the network can be used to send Bitcoin payments nearly instantly, and help you set up a web store to do process these payments. 

### Workshop 4: Permissioned Blockchains
Private blockchains allow businesses and individuals to share sensitive data with a high degree of accountability. In this workshop we will help you build a hyperledger supply chain, and connect it to your web store so that you can pay your suppliers automatically with Bitcoin Lightning payments. 

### Workshop 5: Web3 and Decentralization
The final session of our bootcamp explores how to use Ethereum and other Web3 services to build decentralization applications and technology. In this lesson, we'll help you integrate uPort identity verification to support your web store and provide additional functionality based on the identity of your customer.
